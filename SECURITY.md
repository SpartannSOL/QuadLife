# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This security policy covers every version of the QUADLIFE TOKEN WEBSITE from v1.0 onwards. 
We regard employing first-class security measures to all our products as top priority. As such,
QuadLife Token has set up a bug bounty program.

This bounty is to encourage pentesters to report and work with us rather than against us.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability or exploit within our website or products please send a detailed report
outlining the following:

 All reports need to be sent to: spartann@quadlife.site
 All reports are subject to analysis by our development team and will need to be replicated in order for 
 a report to be deemed successful. Please be aware that the development teams analysis can take up to 7 DAYS 
 to be reviewed and up to 14 DAYS for payment to occur if the applicant is successful. In the event that both
 a bounty hunter and our dev team discover the same vulnerability, then it will come down to whoever has REPORTED 
 and LODGED the vulnerability first. You will recieve a detailed notification via e-mail about the outcome of your
 report, regardless of the oiutcome.
 
 If you have any issues about the result of a report analysis, please try to express it without giving our poor interns
 a nervous breakdown. Any abuse of our team will not be tolerated. We reserve the right to redact an analysis at any time,
 especially if any abuse or threatening behaviour towards our team occurs.
