         <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:18px; color:#fff; ">
            <br>
          In the universe a great power has been bestowed upon those who have embraced their inner Ape.<br><br>
          Legend has it, The most Powerful & Wealthiest Apes in our celestial existence are the Quadrillionaire Apes deriving from the Musa Tribe. 
          The Great Musa Tribe traveled from a galaxy 1 Quadrillion Lightyears away located in a distant not so distant parallel universe, incomprehensible in today’s standards defined
           by modern quantum physics.<br><br>
           These special beings of Apes embarked on a mission to visit other worldly beings throughout the universe and would go on to conquer the inter dimensional atmosphere known as
            Planet Earth.<br><br>
           When the Musa Tribe arrived from Uribin X, Led by the great warrior NakNak, they found a planet full of disparaging ignorance plaguing it’s inhabitants. 
           The first of many kings, NakNak, harnessed his core being’s immense power to emit frequencies and dispersed that energy onto the lands. 
           These immense frequencies transmitted through a gravitational pulse from the middle of the Great Quadrillionaire Gorilla Ape’s Cranium were intensely concentrated 
           and resulted immediate effects. The Quadrillionaire Apes began Amassing an extensive wealth by extracting various precious metals, resources, energy and molding 
           these elements into highly efficient technologies that elevated the planets consciousness.<br><br>
           NakNak began interacting with the planets beings and simultaneously delivered the wisdom acquired from the universe to those with pure energy.<br><br>
           NakNak viewed earth and all living beings as a creation deriving of a higher power mightier than him in which all beings can experience universal knowledge from. 
           When NakNak started emitting these frequencies he noticed his ability began connecting to the natural frequencies embedded in every beings experience of living.<br><br>
           His immense vibrational frequency emitting became so powerful, that when in unison with the Musa Tribe of Quadrillionaire Apes, Great Miracles of time bending 
           phenomena occurred.<br><br>
           The Musa Tribe began conjuring up such immense power together, that the world began to change instantly with every thought the tribe envisioned and in turn manifested. 
           Soon, The frequencies intensified. The apes realized that with great power comes great responsibility.<br><br>
           NakNak Asnam, The First King Of The Quadrillionaire Ape Gorilla Musa Tribe set out to explore this new planet Earth in highly sophisticated space crafts known as Cyphers.
           <br><br>
           When landing in different time zones, the humanoids were amazed by the advanced technology contained within the Cypher. Although language was a barrier to begin with, 
           NakNak emitted the vibrational frequency comprehensible to all beings he encountered.<br><br>
           Through these encounters the humanoids developed a greater understanding of the universe and the power of beings.<br><br>
           The Musa Tribe continued to thrive advancing their territory and cities by having clear visions of the future for planet Earth and manifesting these thoughts into 
           the physical realm instantaneously. They built some of the most intriguing, highly advanced structures known to man over night with pure energy that arranged the world 
           around them. By Bending light,time and matter, a self sustaining civilization was being created daily in the blink of an eye.<br><br>
           Upon his travels NakNak Asnam decides to deep dive into the furthest regions of the planet and discovers a giant reptilian island. 
           What happened next, sent the tribe on a course to almost non-existence.<br><br>
           While on the giant reptilian island, NakNak attempts to connect with these new beings. In the midst of sharing his vibration with these new creatures he becomes aware 
           that these reptilians had no interest in living in harmony. In fact the cold blooded reptilians were only interested in dominating the Earth and destroying anyone in 
           their path. At this point NakNak realized he was too late.<br><br>
           He had already shared his knowledge of technology and wisdom with the reptilians who began to develop their civilization further technologically with the determination 
           to eradicate all beings from planet Earth and embark on a mission to colonize the humanoids enslaving the beings forever.<br><br>
           NakNak had no choice but to use his Cypher, which came equipped with a beam capable of super heating surfaces, and used his weapon to destroy these creatures off of the 
           face of the Earth. He succeeded partially. The survivors of this blast became even more driven towards destruction after witnessing the unlimited capabilities of the 
           Great NakNak.<br><br>
           NakNak returns to the tribe immediately. Upon his arrival he warns the Musa Tribe of the great dangers that await. He instructs his tribe on the clear objective to save 
           planet Earth. That night the tribe gathers and begins transcendental alchemical manifestation to bring about a new technology. The technology allowed NakNak to warn all 
           the humanoids of the grave danger the giant reptilians posed to planet Earth. While transmissions of the warnings were being broadcasted to the other civilizations,
            NakNak sees the gruesome attacks on the humanoids conducted by the giant reptilians.<br><br>
            Now faced with a decision to save lives of the Musa Tribe, NakNak gathers the tribe for an intergalactic travel towards safety. By the time the reptilians arrive with 
            their humanoid slaves the Great Musa Tribe was gone. Leaving behind their highly advanced cities and structures that would be later destroyed by the giant reptilians, 
            making ancient relics of what was once the thriving civilization constructed by the pure energy of The Great Musa Tribe of Apes. The last known scripture from the Great 
            Musa Tribe of Gorilla Quadrillionaire Apes is a coded currency in the nodes known as QuadLife. The only way to unlock the full potential of our minds is to live the 
            Quadrillionaire’s Ape lifestyle of Just Ape It.<br><br>
            The Great Quadrillionaire Gorilla Ape Musa Tribe (QuadApiens) is said to still orbit planet Earth making frequent visits to its humanoid allies in their dreams.<br><br>
            You are being urged to listen to your heart and discover your particular source of power if the Gorilla has appeared to you in your dreams. The unique inner power that 
            every being possesses is their genuine power, and when it is recognized, it contributes to the unfolding of what is destined.<br><br>
